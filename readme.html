            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><i>"The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it
            out."</i> - Proverbs 18:15
            </p>
            <p>
            DynDataAccess is a plugin for the DynRPG project. If you've taken the time to download
            this plugin then odds are you're already familiar with DynRPG and how to use it, but
            just in case, you can find the main DynRPG website at
            <a target="_blank" href="http://rewking.com/dynrpg/">http://rewking.com/dynrpg/</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            The DynDataAccess plugin allows access to data in <i>RPG Maker 2003</i> that is
            ordinarily hidden from developers. It contains commands for copying internal data into
            <i>RPG Maker 2003</i> variables, and sometimes the other way around. It has also picked
            up a few extra commands, such as making an enemy flash or pop up text.
            </p>
            <p>
            DynDataAccess is a living project, intended to expand as needed. The task of creating
            commands for every possible data access would be a very large one, and much of it would
            likely go unused. Hence, I am leaving it to individual developers to add new commands
            when they find they want to access new parts of <i>RPG Maker 2003</i>'s internal data.
            See <a href="#how_to_contribute">How to Contribute</a> for more details.

            <p>
            A quick plug for the integrity and harmony of the <i>RPG Maker</i> community: please buy
            the official English translation of <i>RPG Maker 2003</i>! Obviously I'm in no position
            to shame anyone who has used the fan port of <i>RPG Maker 2003</i> up until now,
            especially since as of this writing there is no DynRPG patch for the official <i>RPG
            Maker 2003</i>. Still, now that the official version is available (and not that
            expensive to boot), there's really no excuse not to purchase a license for at least
            legitimization, even if you continue to make use of the fan port. The creator of DynRPG,
            David "Cherry" Trapp, was instrumental in negotiating the creation and release of the
            official English translation of <i>RPG Maker 2003</i>, and he continues to work on
            improving it. Let's give the owners of the <i>RPG Maker</i> franchise some motivation to
            continue working amicably with the modding community! You can purchase <i>RPG Maker
            2003</i> at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/programs/rpg-maker-2003">RPG Maker Web</a>

        <section><a name="setup" />
            <h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
            <p>
            To install DynDataAccess in an <i>RPG Maker 2003</i> project:
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure that your project is <a target="_blank" href="http://rewking.com/dynrpg/patch.html">patched with DynRPG</a></li>
                <li>Copy the file DynDataAccess.dll from the DynPlugins folder of the DynDataAccess project to the DynPlugins folder of your project</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section><a name="config" />
            <h2>Configuration Options</h2>
            <p>
            DynDataAccess does not have any configuration options. You do not need to modify your
            project's DynRPG.ini file in order to use DynDataAccess.
            </p>
        </section>
            
        <section><a name="comment_commands" />
            <h2>Comment Commands</h2>
            <p>
            Comment commands are the primary way for <i>RPG Maker 2003</i> scripting in-game to
            communicate with DynRPG plugins. DynDataAccess is <i>entirely</i> about comment
            commands, specifically ones which retrieve data for storage in <i>RPG Maker 2003</i>
            variables and sometimes vice-versa. To make a comment command in <i>RPG Maker 2003</i>, use
            the Insert Comment event command option in the scripting of an event and put the
            appropriate text within the comment. Often, you will want to use variable values rather
            than preset values as arguments. You can do this by using DynRPG's standard syntax for a
            variable in a comment command, which is a V followed by the number of the variable you
            wish to reference. For example,
            </p>
            <p>
            <examplecode>@dyndataaccess_get_enemy_current_hp 5, V10</examplecode>
            </p>
            <p>
            would use the value of the game's 10th variable as the second argument of the command.
            </p>

            <p>
            As mentioned in the introduction, DynDataAccess is a living project. The size and
            usefulness it grows to depends on the contributions of developers. If you find yourself
            wanting access to data not already covered by the commands in DynDataAccess, please
            consider adding the necessary commands yourself and sharing the results. Even if you
            have no experience with making DynRPG plugins or even programming in C++, the code
            patterns used to make DynDataAccess commands are simple and repetitive enough that you
            may be able to copy and modify the existing commands. You could also do just part of the
            process, like researching what data is available in DynRPG and modifying this readme
            file to include the commands you'd like to see available, then submitting the results
            with a request for somebody more code-savvy to do the actual programming. Some work done
            is better than none. The subsections below will describe how to accomplish different
            steps in the process of adding to DynDataAccess.
            </p>
            
            <a name="check_existing" />
            <h3>Check Existing DynDataAccess Commands</h3>
            <p>
            This might seem like a no-brainer, but the first thing you should do is make sure the
            command you want doesn't already exist. Take a careful look through the
            <a href="#comment_commands">comment commands</a> to determine whether there's one that
            gives access to the data you want.
            </p>
            
            <a name="research_data" />
            <h3>Research Data Made Available in DynRPG</h3>
            <p>
            Before trying to actually make any changes, you should research whether the data you
            want to access is something that DynRPG makes available and if so where it is held. You
            can do this by looking at the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rewking.com/dynrpg/annotated.html">DynRPG class list</a>.
            The length of the list and the cryptic names of some of the classes may be intimidating,
            but don't let it deter you. Think about the data you want access to and try to find a
            class that sounds like it's related to that. For example, if you wanted to access the
            speed of the Airship map event, you should look at the Vehicle class.
            </p>
            <p>
            Once you've pulled up the reference page for a class, take a look through its attributes
            and functions for anything that looks like the data you want to access. Note that there
            may be a line that says something along the lines of "Public attributes inherited from
            X" or "Public member functions inherited from X". Click on these lines to display the
            properties inherited from the parent class. For the example of the speed of the Airship
            map event, the speed turns out to be a public attribute inherited from the Character
            class.
            </p>
            <p>
            Finally, you'll need to find out what variables are in the RPG namespace for the class.
            Usually there is a listing of relevant variables in the "See also" section of the
            class's page. If you can't find what you want there, though, try looking in the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rewking.com/dynrpg/namespace_r_p_g.html">RPG namespace page</a>.
            For the example of the Airship map event, there is a special variable called
            RPG::vehicleAirship, which gives access to the Vehicle object for the Airship. As long
            as we're getting access to the Airship, though, why not be thorough and include the
            other two Vehicles, represented by RPG::vehicleSkiff and RPG::vehicleShip? Note down the
            variable(s) and attribute(s) and/or function(s) for the data you want to access.
            </p>

            <a name="update_readme" />
            <h3>Update This Readme File With New Comment Commands</h3>
            <p>
            Once you've determined where the data you want to access is in DynRPG, you should plan
            out what the commands for accessing the data should look like and update this
            readme.html file to include them. Open readme.html in your favorite text editor (I
            recommend Notepad++, but plain old Windows Notepad would work just fine) and find the
            section about Comment Commands. Copy and paste some existing comment commands to give
            yourself an easy template for creating your own comment commands. Unless you're adding
            more commands to an existing group of commands, you should also copy a group header and
            rename it for your commands. Just so we have a standard about the order commands are
            listed in, try to position your group of commands relative to the other groups in the
            same order that their associated classes are listed in the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rewking.com/dynrpg/namespace_r_p_g.html">RPG namespace page</a>.
            For the example of accessing data about Vehicle events, you could name the group
            "Vehicle data commands", and give it commands like "@dyndataaccess_get_airship_speed"
            and "@dyndataaccess_set_airship_speed". Keep it simple and straightforward.
            </p>
            
            <a name="update_plugin" />
            <h3>Update the Plugin</h3>
            <p>
            Now comes the most intimidating part for new DynRPG developers: updating the plugin
            itself to include the new comment commands. Don't worry, it's not super hard. If you
            haven't worked on making DynRPG plugins before, you'll first need to install the
            programming environment Code::Blocks and configure it to use the DynRPG source code. Go
            to the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://rewking.com/dynrpg/getting_started.html">Getting Started page</a>
            of the DynRPG website, scroll down to the section marked "Hello World - Our first
            plugin", and follow steps 1 through 6 of the directions there.
            </p>
            <p>
            Once you have Code::Blocks installed, use it to open
            DynPlugins/DynDataAccess/DynDataAccess.cbp in the DynDataAccess project. The part you
            will need to add to is a function called onComment, which you can easily find using the
            Search menu. Copy an existing section of code and use it as an example, replacing the
            comment commands with your own, the "RPG::variableName->attributeName" instances with
            the ones holding the data you want, and making any other needed modifications. As with
            the listing of comment commands in this readme file, try to place your new code section
            relative to the existing ones in the order of their associated classes as listed in the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rewking.com/dynrpg/namespace_r_p_g.html">RPG namespace page</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Once you're done updating the code, open the Build menu and select the Build command.
            This will compile the code into the actual plugin. If any error messages appear in the
            console (the text area at the bottom of Code::Blocks by default), do your best to figure
            out what went wrong and fix it. I wish I could tell you all the things which
            <i>could</i> go wrong and how to deal with them, but that would be a book in itself.
            Just carefully compare the code you made with the code that existed before, and pay
            attention to any clues in the error messages. Once you think you've fixed something, do
            a Build again, and keep trying until there are no error messages.
            </p>
            <p>
            <i><b>Alternate Method: No Code::Blocks</b></i>
            </p>
            <p>
            If downloading and installing Code::Blocks and setting up for DynRPG development on your
            machine seems like too much of a hassle for you, you <i>can</i> simply open the file
            DynPlugins/DynDataAccess/DynDataAccess.cpp using the text editor of your choice and
            modify the DynDataAccess code that way. However, you won't be able to build your code
            into the actual plugin this way, which means you won't be able to test it or use it in
            your projects until somebody else does a build and makes it available. If you decide to
            go this route, skip ahead to the <a href="#upload_changes">Upload Changes</a> step of
            the process.
            </p>
            
            <a name="test_plugin" />
            <h3>Test the Plugin</h3>
            <p>
            Once you have added your new comment commands to the code and compiled a new version of
            the plugin, you should test your new commands to make sure they work the way you expect
            them to. To do this, open the DynDataAccess demo project in <i>RPG Maker 2003</i> and
            create a new map event, then add some scripting to that event to test out your new
            comment commands. Depending on the nature of the data you're working with, you may need
            to do some additional work, like setting up an enemy troop with extra scripting and
            using your map event to start an encounter with that troop, or placing more map events
            for use in your test. I'm going to assume that as somebody who is taking it upon
            yourself to improve the DynDataAccess plugin, you're familiar enough with <i>RPG Maker
            2003</i> to figure out the details. Feel free to modify the map, add new maps, etc., but
            please try to avoid messing up anybody's existing tests.

                and the entire DynDataAccess folder (the base folder of the entire project, not just
                the one in the DynPlugins folder, and make sure you get the folder itself, not just
                its contents) onto the space that says "Drag files here to add them to your

                <li>In the field that says "Optional extended description...", if you feel there

            With that, your part is done! I (Aubrey the Bard) will be notified of your contribution,
            and I will review it, merge it into the GitHub repository, package up a new download,
            and make it available on the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://rpgmaker.net/engines/rt2k3/utilities/194/">DynDataAccess utility thread</a>
            for all to use.

            <h2>DynDataAccess Source Code</h2>
            <p>
            The source code for the DynDataAccess plugin is provided in the
            DynPlugins/DynDataAccess folder of the DynDataAccess demo project. Feel free to
            modify the plugin to suit your purposes, release alternate versions, use snippets of
            code in other projects, etc. Some credit to Aubrey the Bard would be appreciated if you
            use a significant portion of the source code, but I won't make a big deal out of it.
            Instructions for creating DynRPG plugins can be found on the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://rewking.com/dynrpg/getting_started.html">Getting Started page</a> of the
